fetch-timeout=1000000
fetch-retry-maxtimeout=60000
fetch-retry-mintimeout=10000


**What this file does:**

* `fetch-timeout=1000000`: Sets the network request timeout to a very generous 1,000,000 milliseconds (over 16 minutes). This should be more than enough to prevent timeouts.
* `fetch-retry-maxtimeout` & `fetch-retry-mintimeout`: These settings control how npm retries failed network requests, making it much more resilient to temporary network blips.

**2. Update the Dockerfile**

Now, let's update your `frontend/Dockerfile` to use this new configuration file. It's actually simpler than before.

**Why this is a better solution:**

* **It's the standard:** `.npmrc` is the official way to configure npm for a project.
* **It's cleaner:** Your Dockerfile is no longer cluttered with configuration commands. It focuses only on building the image.
* **It's reliable:** There's no risk of command syntax errors like the ones I gave you before.

### Next Steps

1.  **Create the `frontend/.npmrc` file** with the content I provided.
2.  **Replace the contents of `frontend/Dockerfile`** with the updated version above.
3.  **Run the build command again** from your project root:

    ```bash
    docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
    
Thank you again for your persistence. This robust approach should finally resolve the build error.
